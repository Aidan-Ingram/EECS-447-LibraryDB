\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Overview}
This database project is focused on designing an SQL-based Library Management System (LMS) to efficiently manage books, magazines, borrowers, transactions, and overdue monitoring. By replacing traditional paper-based methods, the LMS will enhance organization, improve data accuracy, and streamline daily library operations. It will feature a structured, user-friendly interface that simplifies record-keeping, enforces borrowing policies, and provides automated tracking of overdue materials. Additionally, the system will generate comprehensive reports to assist librarians in decision-making and overall management.

\subsection{Scope}
The Library Management System (LMS) will oversee various types of materials, such as physical and digital books, as well as magazines. It will facilitate user management, enforce borrowing policies, and track overdue items. The system will regulate borrowing limits according to membership categories, enable reservations, and produce reports. However, it will not incorporate physical checkout mechanisms like barcode scanners or RFID tags, nor will it integrate with external digital content providers.

\subsection{Glossary}
Below is a list of key terms and acronyms used in this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Library Management System (LMS)}: An architecture created to manage
library assets, member enrollments, and transaction operations.
    \item \textbf{Overdue Monitoring}: A device that tracks and records overdue books and
calculates corresponding fees.
    \item \textbf{Membership Type}: A classification of customers that identifies the
borrower ability and charge terms for these customers (for example,
normal, student, old person (senior)).
    \item \textbf{Reservation}: A feature allowing clients to place holds on borrowed items
    \item \textbf{Notifications}: Automated alerts for due dates, overdue items, and reserved book availability
    \item \textbf{Item}: A generalized category for the objects the library contains, categorized by the upper-case "I" to represent the entity that DM, Magazine, and Book inherit from.
    \item \textbf{DM}: Shorthand for Digital Media.
    \item \textbf{ISBN}: International Standard Book Number is a unique identifier assigned to books and other published materials.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Define Relationships}
Determine how the entities are related to each other, including multiplicity (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) and constraints. The relationship format is "\textbf{relationship} Entity" or vice versa.
