# ðŸ“š Team SQLibrary Vision Statement & Overview

## Our Vision Statement:
Our vision is to enhance the library experience for both staff and members by providing a simple yet powerful digital solution that improves workflow, supports efficient borrowing, and fosters better resource management in small-scale library environments, where paper has been the long-standing method of conducting business.

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop a **Library Management System (LMS)** that efficiently manages a small library's collection, tracks memberships, enforces borrowing rules, and generates insightful reports. This system aims to replace the traditional paper-based processes, offering a more efficient, digital solution tailored to small-scale libraries.

## System Overview:
We will create a **modular database** that acts as a compact, yet powerful tool for managing library operations. Designed specifically for small libraries that have historically relied on paper-based systems, this database will streamline the daily tasks involved in managing library resources and client information.

The LMS is intended to:
- Improve the quality of life for librarians and library users by reducing manual work and providing digital solutions to everyday tasks.
- Enhance the borrowing and return process, making it more efficient for both library staff and members.
- Streamline administrative tasks, reducing the time spent on routine operations and allowing staff to focus on providing a better user experience.
  
The system will be designed with a focus on simplicity, ensuring that it is both **user-friendly** for library staff and **accessible** for library members, improving overall engagement and satisfaction in a small-scale library environment.
